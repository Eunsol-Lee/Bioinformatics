This repository is my own note.
I plan to sort out what I learned while I was in graduate school.

## Week 5: Basics of Bioinformatics
- Bioinformatics
  - Interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, statistics, etc.
- Introduction to probability distributions
  - Random variable (확률 변수)
    - Discrete random variable
    - Continuous random variable
  - Probability functions
    - 0 ≤ *p(x)* ≤ 1.0
    - Are under a probability function is always 1
  - Probability mass function (pmf)
    - discrete probability distribution
    - ex) *p(x=1)*=1/6
  - Probability density function (pdf)
    - continuous probability distribution
  - Cumulative distribution function (cdf)
    - *P(x≤1)*=1/6
  - Expected value and variance
    - Expected value (mean)
      - mean of random variable x
      - E(X) = µ
    - Variance (standard deviation squared)
      - s(sigma)^2 = Var(x) = E(x-µ)^2
      - expected (or average) squared distance (or deviation) from mean
      - Var(X) = s(sigma)^2
      - SD(X) = s(sigma)
  - Binomial probability distribution
    - n: observation
    - binary outcome
    - constant probability for each observation
    - *X ~ Binom(n, p)*
      - *E(X) = np*
      - *Var(X) = np(1-p)*
      - *SD(X)= sqrt(np(1 - p))*
  - Normal distribution
    - *N(µ, s(sigma)^2)*
  - Standard normal distribution
    - N(0, 1)
    - Z
  - t-distribution
    - looks like normal, but slightly thicker tail than normal
    - occurs when you estimate mean and variance of distribution from data
    - degree of freedom depends on sample size of estimation
    - when d.f. is large, t converges to normal
  - Chi-square distribution
    - Z^2 follows x1^2 (chisqaure distribution with 1 d.f.)
    - Z1^2 + Z2^2 follow x2^2 (d.f.=2)
- Basic statistics for BI
  - P-value
    - probability that one would observe same or more extreme observation under null hypothesis
  - null hypthesis(H0)
    - uninteresting situation
  - alternative hypthesis(H1)
    - interesting situation
  - Easy-to-use statistic's properties
    - designed to be zero for H0, and non-zero for H1
    - it follows a known distribution (normal, t, ..) under H0
    - z-score
      - if a static follows (N0,1) under H0
  - Central limit theorem
    - sample is large --> normally distributed
    - sample is small --> often follow t-distribution
  - Normal vs chisquare distribution
    - z follows N(0,1) --> z^2 follows chi-square distribution with d.f. 1
    - pchisq(3.2^2, df=1, lower.tail=F)
  - Statistical power
    - chance that data will be significant if H1 is true
    - opposite concept of P-value
    - function of sample size, effect size
    - 대립가설이 사실임에도 불구하고 귀무가설을 채택할 확률: 2종 오류(β error)
    - statistical power = 1 - β
  - Permutation test
    - repeatedly shuffle data to impose null hypothesis
    - useful if statistic doesn't have known distribution, or if sample size is too small for CLT to work
  - 2x2 table analysis
    - chi-square test formula
    - Fisher's exact test
  - t-test
  - ANOVA
    - Analysis of Variance
    - If means of >2 groups are equal
    - follows F-distribution
  - Log-rank test
    - for survival analysis
    - Kaplan-Meier curve (Visualization)
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
