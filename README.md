Bioinformatics A-Z

This repository is my own note.
I plan to sort out what I learned while I was in graduate school.

## Week 5: Basics of Bioinformatics
- Bioinformatics
  - Interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, statistics, etc.
- Introduction to probability distributions
  - Random variable (확률 변수)
    - Discrete random variable
    - Continuous random variable
  - Probability functions
    - 0 ≤ *p(x)* ≤ 1.0
    - Are under a probability function is always 1
  - Probability mass function (pmf)
    - discrete probability distribution
    - ex) *p(x=1)*=1/6
  - Probability density function (pdf)
    - continuous probability distribution
  - Cumulative distribution function (cdf)
    - *P(x≤1)*=1/6
  - Expected value and variance
    - Expected value (mean)
      - mean of random variable x
      - E(X) = µ
    - Variance (standard deviation squared)
      - s(sigma)^2 = Var(x) = E(x-µ)^2 
      - expected (or average) squared distance (or deviation) from mean
      - Var(X) = s(sigma)^2
      - SD(X) = s(sigma)
  - Binomial probability distribution
    - n: observation
    - binary outcome
    - constant probability for each observation 
    - *X ~ Binom(n, p)*
      - *E(X) = np*
      - *Var(X) = np(1-p)*
      - *SD(X)= sqrt(np(1 - p))*
  - Normal distribution
